<h2>About the repository:</h2>

<p>
This respository has the coding work I've done to my Procedural Programming Class in my university.
supervised by my professor/tutor: 
Ph.D Igor Santos Perreta <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-santos-peretta/"> [Linkedin] </a>

In each code, I've practiced knowledge brought in class through activities requested by my professor.

I'm working in maintaning the documentation readable and soon will have those activities linked by each activities.
